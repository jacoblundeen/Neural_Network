# Neural Network
This project implements a Feedforward Neural Network with backpropagation.

Features:
* For classification:
  * Uses logistic regression at the input layer
  * Uses cross-entropy loss
  * The output is linear
* For regression:
  * Uses a simple linear network
  * Uses mean squared error
  * The output is softmax
* Backpropagation is implemented to train the neural network
* An Autoencoder is implemented
